# Runescape-Archeology-Tool
RuneScape Archeology Tool is a console-based application to manage your current Runescape Archeology collections. The application is built with C#, and the progress is stored in JSON files.

Motivation:
I am a RuneScape 3 player, and I like the Archeology skill. Since I was using Excel sheets to keep track of my collection progress, I was inspired to create a small console-based tool.
