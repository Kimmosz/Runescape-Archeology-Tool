# Runescape-Archeology-Tool
A console-based tool to manage your current Runescape Archeology collections. 

I am a Runescape 3 player and like to do the Archeology skill.
Since I was using excel sheets to keep on track my collection progress, I was inspired to create a console-based tool.

I will soon add the application to my Itch.io page where you can download and try it out: https://kimberlysalemink.itch.io/
